# Face Detection and Recognition AI Application Readme

This AI application is designed to detect and recognize faces in images or videos. It utilizes pre-trained face detection models such as Haar cascades or deep learning-based face detectors for efficient face localization. Optionally, the application includes face recognition capabilities through advanced techniques like Siamese networks or ArcFace, allowing for unique identification of detected faces. Users can easily set up and run the application in a Python environment, benefitting from the versatility of both pre-trained models and advanced recognition methods. The readme provides clear instructions for implementation, discusses the underlying technologies, and encourages customization for specific use cases, offering a comprehensive guide to understanding and utilizing facial detection and recognition in AI applications.
