Project 1: Simple Rule-Based Chatbot Overview This project implements a simple chatbot that responds to user inputs based on predefined rules. The chatbot utilizes if-else statements and pattern matching techniques to identify user queries and provide appropriate responses. This project serves as a foundational introduction to natural language processing and conversation flow. Features

Project 2: Tic-Tac-Toe AI Overview This project implements an artificial intelligence (AI) agent that plays the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe against a human player. The AI utilizes the Minimax algorithm to make optimal moves and ensure an unbeatable performance in Tic-Tac-Toe. This project aims to provide insights into game theory and basic search algorithms.

Project 3: Face Detection and Recognition Overview This project develops an AI application that can detect and recognize faces in images or videos. It uses pre-trained face detection models like Haar cascades or deep learning-based face detectors, and optionally adds face recognition capabilities using techniques like Siamese networks or ArcFace. Features Face detection using Haar cascades or deep learning models. Optional face recognition with Siamese networks or ArcFace. Learning Objectives Implement face detection using pre-trained models. Explore face recognition techniques with Siamese networks or ArcFace. Understand the application of computer vision in AI.
